/**
 * Playwright e2e config.
 *
 * Tests run against a SEPARATE throwaway stack (`docker-compose.e2e.yaml`) that the root
 * `make test-e2e` brings up: the frontend on :5273 proxies `/v1` to the backend, Postgres lives in
 * tmpfs and is torn down after the run; the dev database (`docker compose up -d`, :5173) is not
 * touched. So there is NO `webServer` here: the stack lifecycle belongs to the Makefile, not Playwright.
 *
 * The default baseURL is the throwaway stack's port (:5273), not the dev frontend's (:5173): a bare
 * `npm run e2e` must not accidentally hit the dev stack and pollute its DB. Overridable via
 * E2E_BASE_URL (`make test-e2e` sets it; e.g. for CI against another host).
